# Russian-Ukraine 2022 War Stats

This project tracks stats of the 2022 Russian-Ukraine war.

default.csv is a human-readable CSV file tracking Russian losses during the war (with data sourced from The Kyiv Independent).
format1.csv (which can be generated from default.csv using makeFormat1.py) is a more computer oriented format (useful for graphing the data).

I made a graph of the data using format1, available on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@realandrew/russian-losses-in-the-2022-war-with-ukraine).

These are currently the only stats being tracked, but I'm open to adding other stats if I can find semi-reliable sources of such information (such as Ukrainian losses).
